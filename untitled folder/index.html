    <p>If you read, you can become great! I have read so many books and they were great! My favorite book is Harry Potter. Personally, I like Neville Longbottom because he obeys the rules. Harry Potter falls into trouble <i>intentionally</i>! You can watch the movies on Amazon Prime Video or Youtube but I would prefer the books. You can read the Naughtiest Girl as well. It is about the Naughty Elizabeth Allen going to school. If you read any book, it will take you to another world! No need to travel. You can go to the other world by sitting on a couch! I have met an author in my school. His name is Ken Spillman. Our teachers read one of his books for us. If you want to improve your English, you can go for Harry Potter.</p>
